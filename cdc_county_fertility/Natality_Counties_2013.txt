Caveats:
"1. 'Not Available' appears when the denominator population for a rate measure is not available."
"2. 'Missing' appears when county data is not available for a certain year. This occurs because the county did not meet minimum"
"population standards and thus the data for the county was recoded to the ""Unidentified Counties"" category for the state of the"
"county."
"3. 'Suppressed' appears when the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"4. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"5. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 100,000 persons or more. Within each state, data for all"
"counties with fewer than 100,000 persons are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties."""
"6. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for"
"age, race, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set mother's age selecting some years"
"not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included in the denominator population. If"
"you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, the denominator population returned will be zero and"
"flagged ""Not Available""."
